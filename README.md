# Bellabeat Case Study Analysis

**Note to Recruiters:**  
In my resume project section, I had mistakenly mentioned that I analyzed *10,000+ daily activity records*.  
I sincerely apologize for this error. The correct dataset size was **940 daily activity records**, and the corrected insights are presented below.

● Analyzed **940 daily activity records** from smart devices to calculate KPIs: steps, calories, activity distribution.  
● Found users averaged **7,637 steps/day** (24% below the 10,000 goal) and spent 81% of time sedentary, driving engagement recommendations.
